Conclusions:
============
* When the gpu load is not high, for some reason gpu training alone takes 10-15-20% (12%-24-30% more exact) longer than for gpu process running with cpu process at the same time (2 processes). For cpu it is about the same time (cpu alone or cpu with gpu). Maybe some interplay for memory movement (more efficient CPU<->GPU memory movement; or CPU more utilized more efficent movement or something; really do not know).
* Current implemntation has no code for random seed and training path is different.
* Accuracy changes with channels 55-60max-60max-47% for 6-60-600-6k channels.
* Ratio of training time CPU/GPU (GPU faster by) goes 1 (rough) (when both running 1.1) - 1.15 (rough) (both running 1.24) - 2.5 - 8.
* No difference in accuracy either CPU or GPU.
* Batch of 40 (mistype fixed from 60 to 40) instead of 4 (mistype fixed from 6 to 4) slightly improves very bad accuracy for 6k channels from 47% to 52% but harms for 600 channels from the best 60% to 48%.
